# PayrollCalculator

This is a Java Swing application that calculates the gross pay, federal tax, provincial tax, and net pay of an employee based on their hourly wage, hours worked, and province of employment. The application has a simple GUI interface with text fields for inputting the necessary data and a button to trigger the calculation. The results are displayed in a text area.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you need to have a Java runtime environment installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java SE from the official website.

Once you have Java installed, you can run the application by executing the following command in the terminal:

`java -jar PayrollCalculator.jar`

Alternatively, you can run the application by opening the JAR file from your file manager or by double-clicking on it.

## Usage

When you run the application, a window will appear with several input fields and a "Calculate" button. Here is what each field does:

    Employee name: Enter the name of the employee whose payroll you want to calculate. This field is optional.
    Hours worked: Enter the number of hours that the employee worked during the pay period.
    Hourly wage: Enter the hourly wage of the employee.
    Province of employment: Enter the two-letter code of the province where the employee works. For example, "ON" for Ontario or "BC" for British Columbia.

Once you have filled in the necessary fields, click the "Calculate" button to perform the calculation. The results will be displayed in the text area on the right side of the window.
